## Essential Questions

1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
   I start by stepping into the user’s shoes—identifying their goals, pain points, and expected outcomes. Writing user stories (“As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]”) forces me to frame each requirement in clear, testable language. Breaking down big needs into small stories lets me deliver value incrementally and gather feedback early, ensuring the end product truly solves user problems.

2. **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
   I follow an iterative, test-driven workflow: build the smallest slice of functionality, write automated tests, demo it to stakeholders, then refine based on feedback. In future projects I’ll embed backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to keep the team aligned and adaptable. I also plan to adopt continuous integration/delivery pipelines and pair-programming sessions to catch defects early and share knowledge.

3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
   Being a strong team member means communicating clearly, offering help proactively, and owning both successes and setbacks. It means showing up prepared for stand-ups, voicing risks before they become blockers, and collaborating on shared artifacts like code reviews and design docs. Above all, it’s aligning personal effort with the team’s goals, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and continuously learning alongside colleagues.
